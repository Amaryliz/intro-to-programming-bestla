      <p>
        My name is Amaryliz Figueroa, and my goal is to become a Software
        Engineer at Disney! I first became intereseted in become a Software
        Engineer after I saw someone on TikTok (yes I know, I know) explaining
        their journey. After that, I kept watching videos about the coding
        journey, I can honestly say I was hooked one becoming a Software
        Engineer. I went on Linkedin and found a free eight week long
        introduction course held by G{Code}. While in G{Code} we were introduced
        to Code the Dream as a possible next step to help in our coding journey.
